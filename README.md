<h3>Memory Match</h3>
<p>A memory game built using React.js.</p>
<h4>Implementation: <a href="https://memory.stephenprabhu.com/">memory.stephenprabhu.com</a></h4>
<p>The game has 3 difficulty levels and 4 different themes:
<ul>
    <li>Beach</li>
    <li>Space</li>
    <li>Kitchen</li>
    <li>Pirates</li>
</ul>
By default, the game shows 6 cards of the beach theme. The cards are shown for one second and then flipped over and the object of the game is to match all cards using the fewest turns. The cards are shuffled at the start of each game.
</p>
<p>
In the <strong>easy</strong> difficulty, 8 cards are shown. In the <strong>medium</strong> difficulty, 12 cards are shown. In the <strong>hard</strong> difficulty, 16 cards are shown. The user is free to mix and match between different difficulty levels and themes.
